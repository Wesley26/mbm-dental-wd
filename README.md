# Information

The work in progress ReactJS project set to update MBM Dental Studios website for Michael Mortellite.


## Important Instructions

- When installing for the first time, run `npm install`.
- For Tailwind CSS dependency, CRACO does all the hard work - a Tailwind.css style sheet file is no longer required. The .eslintcache file should be ignored.
- The `npm update` command runs when you start the app in development mode.
- The `npm run build` command will write to the build folder. Only use when deploying on server.
